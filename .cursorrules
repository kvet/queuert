# Queuert Code Style Guide

## Testing Patterns

- Embed small verification tests into existing related tests rather than creating separate ones
- Test all relevant phases: `claim`, `before-process`, `process`, `finalize`
- Prefer descriptive test names that match what's being tested

## Code Style

- Inline types used in only one place
- Remove obvious comments
- Merge similar functionality

## Session Requirements

- End each agentic session only when all checks pass: `pnpm check` (runs lint, fmt:check, typecheck, test)
- Update documentation (README) if there were changes to public API
