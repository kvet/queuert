## Overview

This document describes the internal implementation of `@queuert/dashboard` — its API layer, frontend architecture, and how it integrates with the Queuert client. The dashboard is a self-contained web application that ships as a single fetch handler with pre-built frontend assets embedded in the package.

## Architecture

```
HTTP Request
    ↓
await createDashboard({ client, basePath })
    ↓
fetch(request) → Response
    ├── /api/*     → JSON API (reads from state adapter)
    └── /assets/*  → Pre-built SolidJS SPA
```

The dashboard accepts a Queuert `Client` instance and returns a `{ fetch }` object compatible with any server that handles the Web Fetch API (`Request` → `Response`).

## API Endpoints

All API endpoints are read-only except `POST /api/jobs/{jobId}/trigger` and `DELETE /api/chains/{chainId}`. They query the state adapter through the Queuert client.

### Chain Endpoints

**`GET /api/chains`** — List job chains with filtering and pagination.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `typeName` | query | Filter by chain type name |
| `status` | query | Filter by status |
| `rootOnly` | query | Return only root jobs |
| `id` | query | Filter by chain ID |
| `jobId` | query | Filter by job ID within chain |
| `cursor` | query | Pagination cursor |
| `limit` | query | Page size |

Returns an array of `[rootJob, lastJob]` pairs and a `nextCursor` for pagination.

**`GET /api/chains/{chainId}`** — Get chain detail with full job sequence.

Returns the root job, last job, all jobs in the chain ordered by chain index, and a map of job blockers.

**`GET /api/chains/{chainId}/blocking`** — List jobs from other chains that depend on this chain as a blocker.

### Job Endpoints

**`GET /api/jobs`** — List individual jobs with filtering and pagination.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | query | Filter by status |
| `typeName` | query | Filter by job type name |
| `chainTypeName` | query | Filter by chain type name |
| `chainId` | query | Filter by chain ID |
| `id` | query | Filter by job ID |
| `cursor` | query | Pagination cursor |
| `limit` | query | Page size |

**`GET /api/jobs/{jobId}`** — Get job detail with continuation and blockers.

**`POST /api/jobs/{jobId}/trigger`** — Trigger a pending job scheduled for the future. Sets `scheduled_at` to now and notifies the notify adapter. Only works for jobs with status `pending`.

### Chain Mutation Endpoints

**`DELETE /api/chains/{chainId}?cascade=true`** — Delete a job chain and all its jobs. Pass `cascade=true` to also delete all transitive blocker chains. Returns the deleted chains on success. Returns 404 if the chain does not exist. Returns 409 if other jobs depend on the resolved deletion set as a blocker (`BlockerReferenceError`).

### Asset Serving

**`GET /assets/*`** — Serves pre-built frontend assets (JavaScript, CSS) with appropriate content types.

**`GET /`** (and all non-API paths) — Serves the SPA `index.html` with a dynamically injected `<base>` tag matching the configured `basePath`. This enables client-side routing to work correctly behind reverse proxies.

## Query Performance

The chain listing endpoint (`GET /api/chains`) joins each root row with the last job in the chain. Filtering by `status` is not optimized — it applies to the joined last job and cannot use an index. Always pass `typeName` to narrow the scan. See [Performance considerations](/queuert/guides/queries/#performance-considerations).

## Frontend

The frontend is a SolidJS single-page application built with Vite.

### Views

**Chain List** (`/`) — Default view showing all chains ordered by creation time (newest first). Each chain displays as a card with type name, chain ID, status badge, last job type, attempt count, and input preview. Supports filtering by chain ID, job ID, type name, and status. Includes cursor-based "Load more" pagination.

**Chain Detail** (`/chains/:id`) — Full job sequence within a chain. Shows each job as a card with input/output JSON, blocker dependencies with links to blocker chains, and a "Blocking" section listing jobs from other chains that depend on this chain.

**Job List** (`/jobs`) — Cross-chain view of individual jobs with the same filtering and pagination patterns as the chain list.

**Job Detail** (`/jobs/:id`) — Detailed job view with status, timing information, worker/lease details, blockers, input/output data, continuation link, and error details. Shows a "Trigger" button for pending jobs scheduled in the future.

### Build and Embedding

The frontend is compiled during package build, not at deploy time:

1. Vite compiles the SolidJS app to static assets in `dist/frontend/`
2. A build plugin reads the compiled assets and generates a TypeScript file (`assets.generated.ts`) containing all assets as string constants
3. The backend build (tsdown) bundles everything — including the embedded assets — into a single distributable file

This means the published package requires no frontend build tools, no `node_modules` for the frontend, and no separate static file serving. The entire dashboard is a single JavaScript module.

## basePath Support

The `basePath` option enables mounting the dashboard at a sub-path behind a reverse proxy or framework router:

```typescript
const dashboard = await createDashboard({
  client,
  basePath: "/internal/queuert",
});
```

The dashboard injects a `<base href="{basePath}/">` tag into the HTML response, which tells the SolidJS router to prefix all routes with the base path. API requests from the frontend are also prefixed accordingly.
