# Scheduling Showcase

Demonstrates recurring job patterns without external cron.

## Scenarios

1. **Recurring Jobs**: Loop chains with scheduled delays
2. **Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate recurring job instances
3. **Time-Windowed**: Rate-limit job creation with `windowMs`

## Running

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```
