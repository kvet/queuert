# Processing Modes Showcase

Demonstrates the three processing modes through an order fulfillment workflow.

## Scenarios

1. **Atomic Mode**: Prepare and complete run in ONE transaction
2. **Staged Mode**: Prepare and complete run in SEPARATE transactions
3. **Auto-Setup Mode**: Just call `complete()` without `prepare()`

## Running

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```
