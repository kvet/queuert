Conformance fixture cleanup. `StateConformanceFixture` now propagates `generateId` and `generateInvalidId` through to the cases — previously the runner only forwarded `stateAdapter` and `poisonTransaction`, so adapters configured with a custom `validateId` could not exercise the caller-supplied `id` path. As part of the fix, the separate `StateAdapterConformanceContext` and `NotifyAdapterConformanceContext` types were collapsed into `StateConformanceFixture` / `NotifyConformanceFixture` so a future field addition cannot be silently dropped at the fixture↔context bridge.

- Added `generateId?: () => string` and `generateInvalidId?: () => string` to `StateConformanceFixture`; `runStateAdapterConformance` now forwards them.
- Removed `StateAdapterConformanceContext` and `NotifyAdapterConformanceContext`. Callers that referenced these types (e.g. `it.extend<NotifyAdapterConformanceContext>(...)` in vitest specs) should switch to `StateConformanceFixture` / `NotifyConformanceFixture`.
