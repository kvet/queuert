# @queuert/redis

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Add feature slices with `mergeJobTypeRegistries` and `mergeJobTypeProcessors`

  Split job type definitions and processors into independent feature modules (slices), then merge them at the application level. Duplicate job types are detected at both compile time and runtime.

  `defineJobTypes` now accepts an optional `TExternal` type parameter for compile-time validation of cross-slice blocker and continueWith references.

  Other changes:
  - Trace context types narrowed from `unknown` to `string | null` across `ObservabilityAdapter`, `StateAdapter`, and all storage backends. Postgres trace columns changed from `jsonb` to `text` (migration required).
  - Navigation utility types renamed for clarity: `JobOf` -> `ResolvedJob`, `JobChainOf` -> `ResolvedJobChain`, `ChainJobTypes` -> `ChainJobTypeNames`, and others.
  - Handler/callback types renamed: `AttemptHandlerFn` -> `AttemptHandler`, `PrepareFn` -> `AttemptPrepare`, `CompleteFn` -> `AttemptComplete`, `CompleteCallbackOptions` -> `AttemptCompleteOptions`, `PrepareConfig` -> `AttemptPrepareOptions`.
  - Registry phantom property replaced with symbol; use `JobTypeRegistryDefinitions<T>` utility type. `PartialJobTypeReference` replaced by `JobTypeReference` union.
  - `JobTypeRegistryConfig` now requires `getTypeNames` callback.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.4.0

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- Replace the per-request CSP `nonce` option with a new `basePath` option on `createDashboard()`. Set `basePath` to your mount prefix when serving the dashboard at a sub-path. The `fetch` handler no longer accepts a second argument. The frontend now derives its base URL from the `<base>` tag, making sub-path routing and asset loading reliable across reverse-proxy setups.
- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.3.2

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix dashboard sub-path asset loading and CSP nonce support. Update documentation with API reference section.
- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.3.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- ### Breaking Changes
  - Redesigned worker to use parallel slot-based execution model
  - Simplified API naming by removing redundant `Queuert` prefix (`createClient`, `createInProcessWorker`)
  - Simplified worker config API by reducing property verbosity
  - Renamed deduplication API from strategy to scope
  - Replaced `withNotify` with `CommitHooks` for explicit side-effect buffering
  - Renamed `CommitHooks` to `TransactionHooks` and added discard support
  - Accept client instance in `createInProcessWorker` instead of individual adapters
  - Replaced `startBlockers` callback with `blockers` array
  - Removed `originId` from job model, use deduplication key for continuations
  - Removed `rootChainId` from job model, unified chain deletion
  - Removed `updatedAt` from `StateJob` and database schema
  - Removed state adapter retry wrapper
  - Split trace context into separate chain and job fields
  - Moved blockers from `Job` base type to separate `JobWithBlockers` wrapper
  - Renamed `waitForJobChainCompletion` to `awaitJobChain`
  - Renamed state adapter methods for clarity and consistency
  - Improved error classes and client API consistency
  - Added `chain_index` for deterministic chain ordering and continuation dedup
  - Changed `deleteJobChains` to return deleted chains
  - Added distributed tracing to `ObservabilityAdapter`
  - Hardcoded `queuert` metric prefix and removed messaging semantic convention attributes in OTEL adapter
  - Cleaned up type exports and renamed reference types

  ### New Features
  - **Dashboard**: New `@queuert/dashboard` package with job and chain listing UI
  - **Client query API**: Pagination and type narrowing for `queryJobs` and `queryJobChains`
  - **Distributed tracing**: OTEL blocker spans with trace context persistence across job chains
  - **Cascade deletion**: `cascade` option on `deleteJobChains` for transitive dependency deletion
  - **`awaitJobChain`**: Await chain completion with configurable polling
  - **Table prefix**: PostgreSQL adapter `tablePrefix` configuration option
  - **Migration tracking**: Migration version tracking for PostgreSQL and SQLite adapters
  - **Transaction hooks**: `createTransactionHooks` for manual flush/discard lifecycle
  - **Documentation site**: Astro-based docs with TSDoc API reference generation

  ### Improvements
  - Parallel slot-based worker execution for better throughput
  - Workers only subscribe to job notifications when idle slots are available
  - Buffered observability events via transaction hooks
  - State and notify adapter conformance test suites for adapter authors
  - Comprehensive examples: query, chain-awaiting, chain-deletion, blockers, error-handling, timeouts, workerless, scheduling, deduplication, processing modes, NATS, multi-worker, ArkType validation, memory footprint benchmark
  - Shared TypeScript configuration via `@queuert/tsconfig` package
  - Redesigned dashboard to use standard Web APIs instead of Hono

  ### Bug Fixes
  - Fixed workers reaping their own in-progress jobs with concurrent slots
  - Scoped deduplication key by chain type name
  - Fixed context leakage to independent chains during job processing
  - Fixed orphaned timers blocking process exit
  - Removed notification listeners before releasing PostgreSQL pool client
  - Only subscribe to job notifications when worker has idle slots
  - Added NOT NULL constraint to `chain_id` column in PostgreSQL and SQLite schemas

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ### Breaking Changes
  - Split `createQueuert` into `createQueuertClient` and `createQueuertInProcessWorker` for clearer separation of concerns
  - Simplified adapter API by removing `provideContext` and making `txContext` optional
  - Changed Log API from tuple args to named `data`/`error` properties
  - Renamed `JobSequence` to `JobChain` across the entire API
  - Simplified `migrateToLatest` API and removed nested transaction support

  ### New Features
  - **ObservabilityAdapter**: OpenTelemetry integration with histogram metrics for duration tracking and gauge metrics for worker state
  - **JobTypeRegistry**: Compile-time and runtime validation with support for Zod, Valibot, and TypeBox
  - **NATS adapter**: New `@queuert/nats` notify adapter with optional JetStream KV
  - **Job attempt middlewares**: Support for contextual logging during job processing
  - **Deferred scheduling**: Schedule jobs for future execution via `schedule` option
  - **Thundering herd optimization**: Hint-based notification system reduces unnecessary polling

  ### Improvements
  - Single-statement migrations for cleaner provider implementations
  - Restructured documentation into modular design docs
  - Reorganized examples to single-purpose design with clear naming conventions
