# @queuert/sqlite

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- - Add `vacuum()` method to Postgres state adapter for on-demand dead-tuple reclamation on job tables. New `vacuum_tuning` migration configures fillfactor and aggressive autovacuum settings to reduce table bloat automatically
  - Add `vacuum()` method to SQLite state adapter for on-demand page reclamation via incremental vacuum. `migrateToLatest()` now validates that `auto_vacuum = INCREMENTAL` is set on the database
  - Fix NATS notification buffering: flush the connection after each publish to ensure timely delivery
  - Relax `@opentelemetry/api` peer dependency from `^1.9.0` to `^1.0.0`

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.10.0

## 0.9.5

### Patch Changes

- - Add `excludeJobChainIds` option to deduplication, allowing callers to skip specific chains during deduplication matching
  - Improve Client type covariance: `Client<A | B>` is now assignable to `Client<A>`
  - Add compile-time validation that `createJobTypeProcessorRegistry` receives a client with all required job types
  - Export `BaseTxContext`, `HookDef`, and `TransactionHooksSavepoint` from the public API
  - Add cascade delete option for job chains in the dashboard UI and API
  - BREAKING: `createDashboard` is now async and must be awaited
- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.9.5

## 0.9.4

### Patch Changes

- Mutating client methods (`startJobChain`, `startJobChains`, `deleteJobChains`, `triggerJob`, `completeJobChain`) now enforce that a transaction context from `runInTransaction` is provided at runtime, throwing `TransactionContextRequiredError` if omitted. This matches the existing TypeScript type requirements and ensures consistent behavior for JavaScript callers.
- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.9.4

## 0.9.3

### Patch Changes

- Simplified `JobAttemptMiddleware` type signature — the second type parameter (`TJobTypeDefinitions`) has been removed from `JobAttemptMiddleware` and `JobTypeProcessorDefaults`. Middleware definitions are now simpler: use `JobAttemptMiddleware<typeof stateAdapter>` instead of `JobAttemptMiddleware<typeof stateAdapter, JobTypeRegistryDefinitions<typeof registry>>`. Additionally, `ResolvedJobChain` now correctly excludes `undefined` from the output type of intermediate chain steps.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix broken package exports in published npm packages
- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.9.1

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- ### Features
  - Error messages stored for failed jobs now include the full stack trace and custom Error properties instead of just `[object Object]` or a bare message string.
  - New observability events `jobChainDeleted` and `jobTriggered` are emitted through logging, OTel, and custom observability adapters.
  - `triggerJob` now guards against non-pending jobs and uses row-level locking to prevent race conditions.

  ### Breaking changes
  - The Postgres adapter default schema is now `"public"` with table prefix `"queuert_"` (previously `"queuert"` schema with no prefix). Pass `{ schema: "queuert", tablePrefix: "" }` to `createPgStateAdapter` to preserve existing behavior.
  - Several internal type exports have been removed: `NavigationMap`, `BaseNavigationMap`, `BaseNavigationEntry`, `JobTypeRegistryNavigation`, `ChainJobTypeNames`, `ContinuationJobTypes`, `EntryJobTypeDefinitions`, `BlockedJobTypeNames`, `ChainTypesReaching`, `JobTypeProcessorRegistryNavigation`, `processorNavigationSymbol`. Use `JobTypeNames`, `JobTypeEntryNames`, and `JobTypeProperty` as replacements where applicable.
  - Merged registry definitions are now a union type instead of an intersection.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.9.0

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- ### Dashboard
  - Fixed job detail continuation lookup to use a targeted query instead of fetching the entire chain, significantly improving performance for long chains.
  - Fixed a race condition where changing filters while a "load more" request was in-flight could append stale results in the chain and job list views.
  - The `leasedBy` badge in the job list now only appears for running jobs.
  - Fixed TypeScript type inference for `createDashboard` — the `client` option now preserves generic types instead of requiring `Client<any, any>`.

- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.8.1

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- **Breaking changes:**
  - Renamed worker and client options for clarity: `registry` is now `jobTypeRegistry`, `processorRegistry` is now `jobTypeProcessorRegistry`, `processDefaults` is now `jobTypeProcessorDefaults`. The `InProcessWorkerProcessDefaults` type is now `JobTypeProcessorDefaults`. `mergeJobTypeRegistries` and `mergeJobTypeProcessorRegistries` now take `{ slices: [...] }`.
  - The `Job` type now has a 5th type parameter `TOutput`. Completed jobs expose an `output` field.
  - Dashboard now takes a `Client` instance instead of raw adapters.

  **New features:**
  - `triggerJob` client method: trigger a pending job immediately, bypassing its scheduled time.
  - `listJobs` now supports a `jobChainTypeName` filter to query jobs by their chain's type.
  - `createJobTypeProcessorRegistry` rejects merged registries at runtime with a clear error message.

  **Bug fixes:**
  - `continueWith` now uses distributive conditional types for correct type checking across union job types.
  - `completeJobChain` rejects un-narrowed union jobs, preventing ambiguous completions.

  **Dashboard:**
  - Chain deletion with confirmation dialog.
  - "Trigger" button for pending jobs.
  - Dashboard now uses the Client API internally with seroval serialization, preserving Date objects in the UI.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.8.0

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- - Add savepoint support to `TransactionHooks` for automatic rollback of buffered side effects. New methods: `withSavepoint(fn)` and `createSavepoint()`. Hook definitions can now provide a `checkpoint` callback.
  - Fix: lease renewal now only runs in staged mode, avoiding unnecessary work in atomic/deferred modes.
  - Fix: error handler properly rolls back transactions on inner failure, preventing inconsistent job state.
  - Fix: default `TJobId` type corrected from `string` to `UUID` on built-in adapters.
  - `StateAdapter.withSavepoint` is now required with simplified positional signature.
  - `HookDef` and `TransactionHooksSavepoint` types are now exported.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.7.0

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- **New: Batch `startJobChains` API** — Create multiple job chains in a single operation with type-safe returns and optimized DB round-trips.

  **New: Savepoint-protected user callbacks** — `prepare` and `complete` callbacks run inside savepoints on PostgreSQL, preventing transaction poisoning. Custom adapters can opt in via `withSavepoint`.

  **Breaking: StateAdapter interface updated** — `createJob`/`addJobBlockers` replaced by batched `createJobs`/`addJobsBlockers`.

  **Breaking: Removed type exports** — `CompleteJobChainResult` and `JobChainCompleteOptions` are now internal.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.6.0

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Add compile-time validation for job type definitions and processor registries. Validation adapters now surface definition errors (missing output schemas, invalid blocker references, unknown type names) as TypeScript errors instead of accepting them silently. `createInProcessWorker` rejects processor registries containing job types unknown to the client at compile time. New exported types: `ValidatedJobTypeDefinitions`, `JobTypeDefinitionErrors`.
- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.5.1

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- **Renamed core APIs for consistency**: `defineJobTypes` is now `defineJobTypeRegistry`, processor registries use `createJobTypeProcessorRegistry`, and `createInProcessWorker` accepts `processorRegistry`. `mergeJobTypeProcessors` is now `mergeJobTypeProcessorRegistries`.

  **`continueWith` restricted to local types**: `continueWith` targets now validate against local job type definitions only. Blockers remain validated against the full set (local + external).

  **Faster type checking**: Navigation types rewritten in tail-recursive form with precomputed maps, reducing type instantiations by up to 86% in blocker-heavy scenarios.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.5.0

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Add feature slices with `mergeJobTypeRegistries` and `mergeJobTypeProcessors`

  Split job type definitions and processors into independent feature modules (slices), then merge them at the application level. Duplicate job types are detected at both compile time and runtime.

  `defineJobTypes` now accepts an optional `TExternal` type parameter for compile-time validation of cross-slice blocker and continueWith references.

  Other changes:
  - Trace context types narrowed from `unknown` to `string | null` across `ObservabilityAdapter`, `StateAdapter`, and all storage backends. Postgres trace columns changed from `jsonb` to `text` (migration required).
  - Navigation utility types renamed for clarity: `JobOf` -> `ResolvedJob`, `JobChainOf` -> `ResolvedJobChain`, `ChainJobTypes` -> `ChainJobTypeNames`, and others.
  - Handler/callback types renamed: `AttemptHandlerFn` -> `AttemptHandler`, `PrepareFn` -> `AttemptPrepare`, `CompleteFn` -> `AttemptComplete`, `CompleteCallbackOptions` -> `AttemptCompleteOptions`, `PrepareConfig` -> `AttemptPrepareOptions`.
  - Registry phantom property replaced with symbol; use `JobTypeRegistryDefinitions<T>` utility type. `PartialJobTypeReference` replaced by `JobTypeReference` union.
  - `JobTypeRegistryConfig` now requires `getTypeNames` callback.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.4.0

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- Replace the per-request CSP `nonce` option with a new `basePath` option on `createDashboard()`. Set `basePath` to your mount prefix when serving the dashboard at a sub-path. The `fetch` handler no longer accepts a second argument. The frontend now derives its base URL from the `<base>` tag, making sub-path routing and asset loading reliable across reverse-proxy setups.
- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@0.3.2

## 0.3.1
