# @queuert/otel

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ### Breaking Changes
  - Split `createQueuert` into `createQueuertClient` and `createQueuertInProcessWorker` for clearer separation of concerns
  - Simplified adapter API by removing `provideContext` and making `txContext` optional
  - Changed Log API from tuple args to named `data`/`error` properties
  - Renamed `JobSequence` to `JobChain` across the entire API
  - Simplified `migrateToLatest` API and removed nested transaction support

  ### New Features
  - **ObservabilityAdapter**: OpenTelemetry integration with histogram metrics for duration tracking and gauge metrics for worker state
  - **JobTypeRegistry**: Compile-time and runtime validation with support for Zod, Valibot, and TypeBox
  - **NATS adapter**: New `@queuert/nats` notify adapter with optional JetStream KV
  - **Job attempt middlewares**: Support for contextual logging during job processing
  - **Deferred scheduling**: Schedule jobs for future execution via `schedule` option
  - **Thundering herd optimization**: Hint-based notification system reduces unnecessary polling

  ### Improvements
  - Single-statement migrations for cleaner provider implementations
  - Restructured documentation into modular design docs
  - Reorganized examples to single-purpose design with clear naming conventions
  - Relaxed peer dependency version constraints

  ### Bug Fixes
  - Prevent context leakage to independent chains during job processing
  - Fix orphaned timers blocking process exit
  - Correct type extraction for dual-context adapters

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - queuert@1.0.0
