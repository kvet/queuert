# Triage

- [?,REF] Add input and output filtering
- [?,REF] Add a method to attempt handler to create a transaction mid run that run guarded check
- [?,REF] Change complete job chain to something more empirical?
- [?,REF] Reset jobs in chains + dashboard

# Short term

- [EPIC] test against bun and its built-in sqlite, postgres, redis clients
- [TASK] Enforce json-serializable inputs and outputs (like no Date in job definitions) — see `design/json-serializable-types.md`
- [EPIC,COMPLEX] SQLite production-readiness — concurrency model (WAL, busy_timeout, drop the `createAsyncRwLock` prescription), batched `createJobs`/`addJobsBlockers`, rewrite examples to production patterns + add multi-worker example, validate `PRAGMA foreign_keys` at init, drop `skipConcurrencyTests`. See `design/sqlite-ready.md`
- [EPIC] State-snapshot OTel gauges — opt-in `@queuert/otel-state` package emitting `incomplete_jobs/chains{type,status}`, `oldest_pending_job/chain_age_seconds{type}`, `stuck_jobs/chains{type}` from a periodic metrics chain (cleanup-style). Adds `attempts_since_reschedule` int column to track retries that aren't progressing via user `rescheduleJob`, three partial indexes over the active working set, and a `getMetricsSnapshot` adapter method. Open questions: single-runner snapshot distribution (DB-stored vs per-process), default stuck threshold. See `design/state-snapshot-metrics.md`
- [EPIC] Built-in job priority — add `priority` field to job schema + secondary sort in acquisition query (composite index `(type_name, priority DESC, scheduled_at ASC) WHERE status = 'pending'`). Design decisions: starvation mitigation (aging? document footgun?), dedup + priority interaction (upgrade semantics when re-enqueuing existing dedup key at higher priority), chain priority inheritance, API surface on `createJob`/`triggerJob`. Backward compatible via `DEFAULT 0`
- [EPIC,COMPLEX] Batched processors — opt-in `batchLimit` on a processor; opportunistic batching (process up to N when available, never wait to accumulate). Array-shaped `attemptHandler({ jobs, prepare, complete })`, one prepare/complete per batch, group lease/complete/reap. Replaces the singular state-adapter methods with array-only counterparts. Open questions: `complete`/`continueWith` shape, group reaping, OTel mapping. See `design/batched-processors.md`

# Medium term

- [?,REF] For update locking in list methods (e.g. `listChainsForCleanup`), add option to skip locking when the method is used in a context where concurrent modifications are not a concern (e.g. cleanup job listing its own completed chains for deletion)
- [REVIEW] Review `addJobBlocker` design — see `design/add-job-blocker.md`
- [REF] Handle routing with seroval on dashboard instead of path-based routing (e.g. `/chains/${chainId}` → `/chain?chainId=${chainId}`) — simplifies dashboard API and allows more flexible UI patterns (modals, nested views)
- [TASK,COMPLEX] Better dashboard UI
- [TASK] Benchmark query performance (`listChains`, `listJobs`, `listChainJobs`, `listBlockedJobs`, `getChain`) across state adapters with seeded datasets — separate tool from `processing-capacity`, dimensions: dataset size, filter selectivity, page size
- [EPIC] Docs website enhancements
  - [TASK] Add interactive examples / live demos
  - [TASK] Custom branding and styling
- [EPIC] MySQL/MariaDB adapter

# Long term

- [IDEA] MCP server
- [IDEA] Add OpenTelemetry logs support to @queuert/otel adapter (OTEL logs API is experimental)
- [IDEA] Hard timeout (worker threads) - True isolation with `terminate()`; enables memory limits and untrusted code sandboxing
- [IDEA] Singletons/concurrency limit
- [IDEA] Partitioning (PG) - Scaling concern; defer until users hit limits
- [IDEA] Browser runtime support - SQLite WASM (OPFS) state adapter, Web Workers as job processors, BroadcastChannel notify adapter
