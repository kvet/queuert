# Short term

- [EPIC] Dashboard
  - [TASK,COMPLEX] Better UI
  - [?,REF] Filter by status in chains view
  - [?,REF] Add inputs for date range filtering in chains and jobs views
  - [?,REF] Add job creation, deletion and completion
  - [REF] Migrate dashboard routes from StateAdapter to client API
  - [REF] Fix job detail: fetches all chain jobs to find continuation — use targeted query
  - [REF] Fix stale cursor race condition on filter change in ChainList/JobList
- [TASK,COMPLEX] Job cleanup utility (see [Plugins](docs/design/plugins.md), [Cleanup Plugin](docs/design/cleanup-plugin.md))
- [REF] Review state adapter method naming for clarity and consistency
- [?,REF] Consider extracting a dedicated chain table at the DB level
- [?,REF] Prepared statements
- [TASK] Review all public methods and types for naming, consistency, and clarity; add inline docs
- [TASK] Inline docs for public methods and types
- [EPIC] Prepare 0.3 release

# Medium term

- [TASK,COMPLEX] Optimized batched lease renewal
- [EPIC] MCP server
- [EPIC] Sqlite ready:
  - [REF] Better concurrency handling - WAL mode, busy timeout, retries
  - [REF] Separate read/write connection pools (single writer, multiple readers)
  - [REF] usage of db without pool is incorrect
  - [TASK,EASY] Validate `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` at adapter init (FK on `job_blocker.blocked_by_chain_id` requires it)
  - [TASK,EASY] get rid of skipConcurrencyTests flag in resilience tests (separate test suite?)
- [EPIC] MySQL/MariaDB adapter
- [REF] Revisit Prisma examples
- [?,TASK] test against bun and it's built-in sqlite, postgres clients
- [?,TASK,MEDIUM] update lease in one operation (currently two: getForUpdate + update)
- [?,TASK,COMPLEX] Consolidate state adapter operations into atomic combined methods
  - `acquireJob` should include `getJobBlockers` (avoid separate call after acquire)
  - `completeJob` should include `scheduleBlockedJobs` and return the completed job (avoid separate `getJobById` after complete)
  - Atomic mode should not need `renewJobLease` (prepare+complete in same transaction)
  - Staged mode should not need `getJobForUpdate` before complete (job already held by worker)
  - See: `process-modes.test-suite.ts` TODOs for per-mode call traces
- [EPIC] Website for docs, examples, dashboard, etc (currently in monorepo README)

# Long term

- [TASK,EASY] Add OpenTelemetry logs support to @queuert/otel adapter (OTEL logs API is experimental)
- [EPIC] Hard timeout (worker threads) - True isolation with `terminate()`; enables memory limits and untrusted code sandboxing
- [EPIC] Singletons/concurrency limit
- [EPIC] Partitioning (PG) - Scaling concern; defer until users hit limits
- [?,EPIC] Browser runtime support - SQLite WASM (OPFS) state adapter, Web Workers as job processors, BroadcastChannel notify adapter
