# Short term

# Long term

- Better StateJobSequence definition
- Finalize job externally (Cancellation)
- Termination (add deletedAt to jobs, worker skips those)
- Custom ids + schema name for jobs
- Redis NotifyAdapter
- Metrics collection (Prometheus, OTEL)
- Publish to NPM
- Zod job type definitions

# Maybe

- Sandboxed execution (worker threads)
- Hard timeout support
- Partitioning
- Singletons/concurrency limit
